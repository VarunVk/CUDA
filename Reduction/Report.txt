   1. How many times does your thread block synchronize to reduce its portion
      of an array to a single value?

      ceil (log2(N))
      n - number of elements.

   2. What is the minimum, maximum, and average number of "real" operations 
      that a thread will perform? "Real" operations are those that directly 
      contribute to the final reduction value.

      Minimum - the last thread in the block- will executed 1 time. 
      Maximum - the first thread in the block - will execute log2(N) times.
      Average - the series is geometric progression, n/2,n/4....,1.
                Thus the sum of "real" operations=Geometric sum of the above series.
                which evaluates to = (n-1), this is the number of the real operations 
                in a block. 
                Average for the above will be, total/number of threads in the block.
                =(n-1)/(n/2)
