Questions And Answers

   1. How many times is each element of the input matrices loaded during the
      execution of the kernel?

	Each element of the input matrix is loaded MATRIX_SIZE times .i.e 16
    times in this case.

   2. What is the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in each
      thread? Consider a multiply and addition as separate operations, and
      ignore the storing of the result. Only global memory loads should be
      counted towards your off-chip bandwidth.

	For every iteration of the for loop in MatrixMulKernel Line 58 
	Number of memory access = Access Matrix M + Access Matrix N
				= 1 + 1
				= 2 
	Number of floating point computation = No. of Addition + No. of Multiplication
					     = 1+1 
	
	Thus memory-access to floating-point computation ratio = 2/2 = 1.0 

	For the entire thread,
		memory-access to floating-point computation ratio = (2*MATRIX_SIZE) / (2*MATRIX_SIZE)
								  = 1.0
